# Dependencies

### Tensorflow

Tensorflow is required for use of the "identification" directory, which uses machine learning to identify an adenocarcinoma on a CT scan.

```

$ pip install tensorflow

```
To check if TensorFlow is installed, run:

```

import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.version)

```
